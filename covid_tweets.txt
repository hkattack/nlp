I can't wait for this pandemic to be over!
Stay safe everyone. #COVID19
This lockdown is driving me crazy.
I'm grateful for the frontline workers. #heroes
I tested positive for COVID-19. Feeling scared.
The vaccine rollout has been impressive.
I lost my job due to the pandemic.
It's frustrating to see people not following guidelines.
